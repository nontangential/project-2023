add pools to asset manager
handle destroying by passing views to manager.destroy(view) which will auto-return it to pool

move out as engine, separate game class

turn managers into plugins

externally added game tree

UI separate from menu

should managers be per-stage or reset? (assets should be global but enemies/projectiles who knows)
